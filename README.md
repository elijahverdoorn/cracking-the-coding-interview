# Cracking the Coding Interview
_Cracking the Coding Interview_ is a book by Gayle Laakmann McDowell which I am using to practice for coding interviews and keep sharp on my programming skills. My solutions will be in a variety of languages.

## Conventions
I have chosen for compiled files to be labeled as `.out`.

## Testing
In order to practice Test-Driven-Development, I have decided to begin adding tests to this code. I have added `catch.hpp`, a c++ testing framework that should enable easy testing. I'm sure that I'll do something wrong along the way, but this should make testing the given conditions in the book easier.`
